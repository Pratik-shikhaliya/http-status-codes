## Usage Examples

### RESTful API Design
```
GET /users/123
‚Üí 200 OK (user found)
‚Üí 404 Not Found (user doesn't exist)

POST /users
‚Üí 201 Created (user created successfully)
‚Üí 400 Bad Request (invalid data)

PUT /users/123
‚Üí 200 OK (user updated)
‚Üí 404 Not Found (user doesn't exist)

DELETE /users/123
‚Üí 204 No Content (user deleted)
‚Üí 404 Not Found (user doesn't exist)
```

### Authentication Flow
```
GET /protected-resource
‚Üí 401 Unauthorized (no token provided)

POST /login
‚Üí 200 OK (credentials valid)
‚Üí 401 Unauthorized (invalid credentials)

GET /protected-resource (with valid token)
‚Üí 200 OK (access granted)
‚Üí 403 Forbidden (token valid but insufficient permissions)
```
